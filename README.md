# Cobwebbing

Scripting tools for creating cobweb diagrams representing the forward-time evolution of discrete dynamical systems.

The 'Iterate' .txt file corresponds to a .m function file helpful for continuously iterating a discrete map.

The 'Cobweb' .txt file correspoinds to the main course: a .m function file that traces a cobweb plot out of a given (hopefully, continuous) discrete dynamical system.

The 'Examples' .txt file (again, a .m function file) contains examples of discrete maps to play around with.
