# Cobwebbing

Scripting tools for creating MATLAB cobweb diagrams representing the forward-time evolution of discrete dynamical systems.

`Iteration.m` corresponds to a function file helpful for continuously iterating a discrete map.

`Cobweb.m` correspoinds to the main course: a function file that traces a cobweb plot out of a given (hopefully, continuous) discrete dynamical system.

`Examples.m` contains examples of discrete maps to play around with.
